1. When the developer needs to redesign the UI or update Model logic, without affecting other components of an app. Model: Movie and PopularMoviesResponse, View: MainActivity and DetailsActivity, ViewModel: MovieViewModel, MovieRepository and MovieAdapter.

4. The model doesn't need to know where the data comes from.

5. Room.databaseCallback, foreground Service, ViewModel, LiveData.
